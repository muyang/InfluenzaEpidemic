### Introduction
In the area of complex networks, it has very important realism meaning in research of the
dynamics of behavior transmission in Spatial Network both in theory and methodology. Spatial
Network is a very special complex networks. Generally, complex network is the abstract model
of reality network; in the model of Spatial Network, which should be considered both the
network properties of topology and relative positions of the network nodes, abstracting from
reality and return to reality again.
Multi-Agent Modeling is a modeling method from bottom to top, in the view of individual
behaviors and movement, based on simple transformation rules, to construct spatial state
discrete of the whole systems and explore the whole properties by statistical induction.
This study combines the Spatial Network and Multi-Agent Modeling and based on
NetLogo simulation platform, establishing a reality geographical spatial network model to
simulate the spatiotemporal transmission of avian influenza-virus. In microcosmic level,
adopting Multi-Agent Modeling to simulate the interaction among individuals and the spatial
diffusion and the process of inflection of virus; in the whole level, map four transmission
pathways into the constructed dynamic spatial network which contains stochastic factors and
deterministic factors, such as spatial information, individual immune status, environmental
information, human behavior and connectivity among individuals.
Finally, this study deals with the influence of group immunity, individual behavior
and the cultivation method to the transmission of avian influenza virus by analyzing the
sampling data, the properties of the network construction, and discuss and sum up the control
strategy, which provides support for further understanding of the explosion and the spreading
rules and characters of avian influenza virus and the efficient prediction and control of it.
